                <p> A 2021 graduate from University Of Toronto, Major in Computer Engineering. 
                    In my undergraduate years I learned the fundamental concepts of computer programming and architecture. 
                    It was mostly focused on C and C++ language, systems and backend programming. 
                    After my 3rd year, I worked at IBM for a 16-month internship where I analyzed system performances 
                    and was introduced to cloud technologies. Post graduation, I worked at Cisco where I was able to take a
                    dive into the world of routers and network programming. Since then, I have realized that I have only been working
                    on the backend of things and decided to expose myself to front-end development. I decided that Web Development would be 
                    a great path to learning front-end so I took the time to go through the "Odin Project" online course. With my background in 
                    backend development and newly learned frontend development skill, I am pursuing to be a Full Stack Developer.
